# Curious Facts

Did you know that 10% of the Russian government’s income derives from the sale of vodka?

Welcome to the Curious Facts project! Our client, Useless Facts, Inc., has requested a single page application in which the user presses a button to generate a “useless fact”.

When they find a fact they can’t stop thinking about, they can save it and create a list of their favourite weird and wonderful facts! 

So if you’re ready to find out how much time the average person spends annually looking for things, or which national parliament features a Speaker who is not allowed to speak, this is the website for you!
